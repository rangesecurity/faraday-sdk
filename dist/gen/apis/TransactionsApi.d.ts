/**
 * Faraday API
 *  The **Faraday API** provides secure, compliant infrastructure for stablecoin transactions, identity verification, and transaction monitoring across multiple blockchains.  ### Key Features - **Swap Routing** — Discover optimal swap paths for stablecoin transfers, including cross-chain routes. - **IVMS101 Person Records** — Create, query, and manage structured person data for FATF Travel Rule compliance. - **Transaction Submission and Monitoring** — Submit and track stablecoin transactions. - **Reporting** — View historical transaction reports including associated IVMS101 records.  ### Authentication Most requests require an API key (Bearer token).  Generate and manage API keys by signing in to: - Production: https://app.range.org/ - Staging: https://stage.range.org/  API Keys can be found under the APIs section. A free monthly credit allowance is available, with more credits available to paid plans.  Include this header with every authenticated Faraday request:  ``` Authorization: Bearer <your_token> ```  ### Base URLs - Production: `https://api.faraday.range.org` - Staging: `https://faraday.api.rase.live` - Local Development: `http://0.0.0.0:3000`  ### Example Request ```bash curl -X GET \'https://api.faraday.range.org/v1/persons\'   --header \'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>\' ```
